# scrnaseq-bioc

Repo comparing bioconductor based scrnaseq analysis with seurat based analysis, see twin repo scrnaseq-seurat.

Dataset used: raw data from this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5my4v4aar5mctau/single_cell_rnaseq.zip?dl=1
available on the page below.

Similar to the project organization within the "single_cell_rnaseq" folder from hbctraining, I have also created folders called "bioc_results" and "bioc_figures" that will hold the respective outputs from the bioconductor / osca / workflow. 

The "data" folder within the "single_cell_rnaseq" folder is common to both seurat and osca
